      "manifesto": "Here at elfDAO, we are elves - the workers, builders, and contributors of holiday cheer.

And <strong>we're sick of seeing \"Santa\" never show up for children less fortunate.</strong>",
      "why": "That's why we've created elfDAO - to fund, organize, and donate gifts to institutions, orphanages, and low-income neighborhood centers <strong>bring holiday joy to as many children as possible.</strong>"

    "manyKids": "For many kids around the globe, Christmas marks one of the most special days of the year. As we gear up for the holiday season, we plan meaningful moments around gifting our loved ones. However, let's remember that <strong>there are many kids that don't get to celebrate Christmas like we do.</strong>",
    "remember": "We must take the time to remember that there are those less fortunate, and in a world where we can utilize awesome tools like DAO to fund community projects, it's a no-brainer for us to help children have a happy Christmas.",
    "joinElfDao": "So come one, come all. Join us on our adventure to work, build, and contribute to the greatest effort to spread holiday cheer in the world. Join elfDAO.",
    "whatSuccess": "What does success look like?",
    "oneIn10": "One in ten families can’t afford to buy gifts this year because of financial strain made worse by the pandemic. There are 74 million kids under 18 in the US. That’s 7.4 million kids missing out on the joys of Christmas in the US alone!",
    "weCare": "We care about those kids. That’s why we’re aiming for a big but worthwhile goal.",
    "goal": "We want to raise <strong>$1,000,000 USD</strong> by Christmas. At $25 USD per gift, our goal is to give 40,000 kids a gift this holiday season.",
    "stats": "[^1]Source: <link>CNBC</link> [^2]The $25 dollar per gift value is estimated referencing Operation Christmas Child's gift box value. The charities voted on by the elfDAO community will have discretion over gift value and other specifics, thus this number only serves as an estimation to convert our ETH raised into approximate number of gifts funded.",
    "howRaising": "How are we raising funds?",
    "raisingJuicebox": "We are raising funds using Juicebox. On our <link>Juicebox site</link>, contributors can directly donate any amount in ETH before December 31st.",
    "theGiftToken": "The $GIFT Token",
    "aboutGift": "All contributors will receive governance tokens proportional to your donation size, at a 670,000 $GIFT/ETH ratio. Governance tokens give you voting power within elfDAO, meaning that you’ll help decide how our funds are spent. The tokens’ sole purpose is for governance and voting rights for elfDAO’s use of funds.",
    "aboutGift2": "The core team will receive 33% of governance token supply as donations flow in through Juicebox. This will be used to make sure that the team has a meaningful say in governance. After the project ends, the core team’s token allocation will be burned.",
    "elfDaoNFTs": "elfDAO NFTs",
    "aboutElfDaoNFTs": "To thank our contributors for their generous contributions, we will be offering thank you NFTs for contributors to mint.

    "whereFunds": "Where will the Funds go?",
    "shortAnswer": "<strong>The short answer</strong>: The DAO will have the ability to choose how and where we spend the funds. The core team has ideas listed below, but remember, we're all elves here, and we want to hear from you.",
    "longAnswer": "<strong>The long answer</strong>: Depending on the size of the funds raised, we could go two ways.",
    "longAnswerOption1": "If our fund size is smaller than 10,000 presents (10k * $25 = $250,000), the core team will present a handful of reputable charitable organizations for DAO members to vote on.",
    "longAnswerOption2": "If our fund size is larger than 10,000 presents ($250,000) giving us the ability to distribute funds across many recipients, we will open for proposals from charitable organizations. Community members will be encouraged to nominate organizations and nudge them to submit proposals. DAO members will then vote on the proposals and help us determine distribution.",
    "longAnswerOption3": "In addition, we will be reserving <link>2.5% of funds raised</link> to cover overhead costs (1% for multi-signature wallet and Juicebox gas fees, 1.5% for enDAOment, our fiscal sponsor’s transaction fees) as managed by the core team. All overhead costs will be transparently documented and none will be used to compensate the core team — <strong>leftover operational funds will be contributed to charity through a proposal.</strong>",
    "community": "As a community-run initiative, we’re decentralizing decision-making about our donation recipients. That’s what makes us unique compared to other Christmas gift-giving charities.",
    "targetGoal": "If we reach our funding target of $1 million, elfDAO’s members will have the opportunity to vote on what local organizations to submit funding proposals to. These organizations could include community centers, orphanages, churches, or other groups who are registered as 501c3 in good standing with the IRS (U.S. Internal Revenue Service), as long as they meet <link>Endaoment’s due diligence and funding policies.</link>",
